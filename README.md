Welcome to the future of blogging!

This will be the defacto standard for blogging. The new amazing features and tools will be
driven by marketing and sales. For now, we will build the skeleton of the application so that
a user can have many blogs with posts and comments!

To get some basic data into the application for developement and testing, please ensure that you
run the command

`bundle exec rails db:seed`

Each user will have a default password of `password` from the seed file
